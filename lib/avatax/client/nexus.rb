      # Create a new nexus
      #
      # Creates one or more new nexus declarations attached to this company.
      #
      # The concept of Nexus indicates a place where your company is legally obligated to collect and remit transactional
      # taxes. The legal requirements for nexus may vary per country and per jurisdiction; please seek advice from your
      # accountant or lawyer prior to declaring nexus.
      #
      # To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
      # list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
      # only the user-selectable fields in this object.
      #
      # The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
      # `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
      #
      # When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
      # must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
      # by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.
      #
      # Please note that nexus changes may not take effect immediately and you should plan to update your nexus settings in advance
      # of calculating tax for a location.
      # @param companyId [Integer] The ID of the company that owns this nexus.
      # @param model [NexusModel[]] The nexus you wish to create.

      # Creates nexus for a list of addresses.

      # This call is intended to simplify adding all applicable nexus to a company, for an address or addresses. Calling this
      # API declares nexus for this company, for the list of addresses provided,
